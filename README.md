# Coursera Ethereum Development

The following coursera named directories contain work to pass courses provided by Coursera.
Much of the work was initially done to get the code to compile on modern versions of solidity, truffle, and correct old NPM libraries since the original source was several years old. 

Great learning experience to get a handle on the the development tools, including ganache, truffle, npm, and metamask. 

* Course 2 - Focused on writing smart contracts and using the Remix IDE.  I did most of my development locally with ganache, truffle and VSCode to learn how to make it compile with newer compilers, however the course required older syntax and pragma requirements for the auto-grader.

* Course 3 - This integrated learnings from Course 2, and added on DApp development to gain experience working with both the front end and backend to have a fully functioning Ethereum powered Dapp.  Course 3 had similiar requirements to compile under the solc v0.4.17 compiler. The latest revision of this code as been updated to support solc v0.5.16.
